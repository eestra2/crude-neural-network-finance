# crude-neural-network-finance
An introductory walk-through of using code and machine learning modules for financial programming.

**Goal:**

Predicting 2-months worth of Dow Jones index prices per year from 2007 through 2016 by using neural network model to map market sentiment to DJ index prices.

**Target Audience:**

This walk-through assumes some basic Python knowledge, finance principles, and  general statistics.  Also, this is toy data and modeling, far from perfect in every sense. The goal is to get people with finance/economics background, with amateur coding abilities, get their hands wet with python programming. The aim is to understand what is going on with the coding part (where most business majors lack in) line by line in order to show where everything is coming from and not seem like code is magic. This is not a foremost showcase of the optimal fine-tuned model predicting highly accurate stock prices. This is not the ideal starting point for someone who is starting to program for the first time. Think of this as a good place to step out of the basics of Python programming and start something that is "beginner to mid-level transition". 

**Dependencies:**

pandas, numpy, unicodedata, nltk, sklearn
